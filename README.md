# Primitive_annotations
research project about resilience properties of machine learning algorithms in the sklearn library.
Considered algorithms are: RandomForestClassifier,KneighborsClassfiers, AdaBoostClassifier,SGDClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, BernoullieNB and GaussianNB.
  
 For the project to work you need to save local files.
  In LocalDatasets.py the variables 'dropbox' and 'pathL' need to be paths on your  disk to save and load the data.
  The functions read_did,readDict and read_did_cat can be replaced by functions from oml.
  
To set up this project use the https://github.com/joaquinvanschoren/ML-course/blob/master/00%20-%20Prerequisites.pdf instructions to use juypter notebook and the libraries needed.
